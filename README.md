Maven SCM Integration for Subversion
====================================

This is a fork of Sonatype's Subclipse plugin for m2eclipse. They indicated
that they are no longer maintaining this plugin so I have updated it for the
latest release of Subclipse.

Eclipse p2 Update Site
----------------------

An Eclipse p2 repository has been posted to the following location:

    http://subclipse.tigris.org/m2eclipse/1.0

Notes
-----

We do not use Maven for Subclipse development, so I do not use this plugin. I
will try to maintain it and can certainly update any Subclipse API calls if
needed, but I will need help maintaining the Maven side of this if m2eclipse
changes.  According to some of the pull-requests I have seen, this should work
with m2eclipse 1.x as the API has not changed.
